## Description

For this weekend challenge I expanded on an assigned movie management application. The user was already able to see movies that exist in the DB. I added a detailed view for each individual movie when the movie poster is clicked on, including genres associated with that movie. I also added a feature that allows the user to add a movie to the database. I did not put any time into styling this application, choosing to focus on other assignments instead, but I hope to return to this one and add styling in the future.

### Prerequisites

Express - a web framework for Node.js;
Postgresql - an open source relational database

### Installation

There is a database.sql file to use to set up a database. After that, once you fork and clone the repository, you should be able to run the server and client to be able to use the app.

## Usage

The homepage displays posters and titles for every movie in the database. When you click on a poster, you are routed to a page that displays the movie description and the genres of that movie, which come from a different database. On the homepage, the user can click on "Add Movie" which brings you to a page where the user can input information about a movie of their choice and add it to the movie database. When the user returns to the homepage, that movie will now be displayed with all of the functionality of the other movies.
